# Close issues across repositories

https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-an-issues-only-repository

For example, if you pushed a commit to the private repository's default branch with a message that read Fixes organization/public-repo#12, the issue would be closed, but only users with the proper permissions would see the cross-repository reference indicating the commit that closed the issue. Without the permissions, a reference still appears, but the details are omitted.
